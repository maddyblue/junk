\begin{enumerate}
	\item %1
		$P_{00}^n > 0$ for all $n$. State 1 is not periodic as it can only be the current state during the initial state. $P_{22}^n > 0$ for $n \ge 4$. $P_{33}^n > 0$ for $n \ge 3$. $P_{44}^n > 0$ for $n \ge 2$. $P_{66}^n > 0$ for $n \ge 1$. Hence $d(i) = 1$ for all states.
	\item %2
		States 1, 2, 3, and 4 are recurrent since once we are in states $\{1, 3\}$ or $\{2, 4\}$, we cannot leave the group. States 5 and 6 are transient since there is a $> 0$ chance that we will enter the other 4 states, which would mean we will never return to state 5 or 6.
	\item %3
	\item %4
		At $p = 0$, all states are recurrent since $P$ is the identity matrix. At $p = 0.5$,
		\begin{displaymath}
			P = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0.5 & 0 & 0.5 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right)
		\end{displaymath}
		so all states are recurrent since states 1 and 3 always jumps to state 2 which will jump to states 1 or 3. At $p = 0.25$,
		\begin{displaymath}
			P = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \\ 0.25 & 0.5 & 0.25 \\ 0 & 0.5 & 0.5 \end{array} \right)
		\end{displaymath}
		all states are recurrent for the same reason.
	\item %5
	\item %6
		If all other states $i$ not $s$ communicate with $s$, then for some $n \ge 1, p_{is}^n > 0$, hence all states have a $> 0$ probability of jumping to $s$, and hence being absorbed. When this happens, $P(X_n = i | X_0 = i) = 0$, hence all states other than $s$ are transient.
	\item %7
		If and only if a state $i$ is transient then for some $n \ge 1, P(X_n = i | X_0 = i) < 1$, hence there were a finite number of visits to $i$ and so the mean number of visits to $i$ will be finite. Thus state $i$ is recurrent if and only if for some $n \ge 1, P(X_n = i | X_0 = i) = 1$, hence there will always be another visit to $i$, so the mean number of visits is infinite.
