\begin{letter}{To Whom It May Concern,}

\opening{}

I would like to express my confidence in this young {{ man }}, {{ name }}, who during these 2 years gave all of {{ his }} time and efforts to The Church of Jesus of Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In this time period, this young {{ man }} demonstrated many positive attributes such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Worked 10 to 12 hours daily, openly conversing with people of all different social status levels on the roads, in offices, in residences and in stores (among other locations).
	\item Developed good study habits, as well as learned irreplaceable planning and goal-making skills.
	\item Worked with many different organizations, helping members of the Church to reach their goals and achieve their highest potential.
	\item Spent 24 months living the highest moral standards, developing essential characteristics, such as: honesty, integrity, obedience, spiritual guidance, self confidence and the power of decision.
	\item Became fluent in the Portuguese language, with little to no prior knowledge.
	\item Developed skills such as: public speaking, appreciation for community service, as well as problem solving skills, all while maintaining the highest standards of character and appearance.
\end{itemize}

During this period of 24 months, this remarkable young {{ man }} has worked voluntarily in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, reaching all of {{ his }} goals with success. As such, I recommend this person with all of my confidence for whatever endeavor {{ he }} chooses to undertake.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
