\chapter{Conclusion}

We fabricated a chip with an array of electrochemical sensor cells of varying make. This chip was characterized to find high-performing cells, an optimum amperometry potential for these cells, and the response to various concentrations of expected chemicals that would be released by living cells. Further research with highly-sensitive instruments is needed to determine the limit of detection of this chip.
