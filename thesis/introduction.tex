\chapter{Introduction}

Neurotransmitters play an important role in central nervous systems. Of interest is detecting molecular gradients that are essential in the development of tissue and organ systems. Nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter, is important in this development. Molecular gradients are difficult to detect because of the relative large size of the cells compared to the electrochemical sensors used in sensing systems. Furthermore, in order to detect a gradient, an sensor array must be used in order to collect real-time spatial data. Previous work described the methodology of creating such a sensor array based on CMOS technology. This chip has been fabricated. This paper describes the characterization of the chip in response to expected signals from living cells and presents a potentiostat suitable for this work to be used in a future chip.

Previous work in this field is insufficient for our needs. We expect signals in the picoamp range on the microsecond timescale, and thus require circuitry able to amplify and measure quickly \cite{mosharok2005aee}. Other work has not addressed timing requirements \cite{zhang2005eam} \cite{steffan2007scp}, assumes slow concentration change times on the order of seconds \cite{murari2005ipn}, or uses oversampling (which is slow) to detect low concentrations \cite{murari2005ipn} \cite{stanacevic2007vpa}.
