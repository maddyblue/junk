Previous work has resulted in the production of a chip with an array of sensors of individual design with electrodes on the micron scale capable of performing electrochemistry on living cells. The sensors are characterized, and the best sensors are further characterized to their detection limits. A potentiostat design capable of measuring the low currents expected from living cells is presented for future use in a chip.
