\chapter{Introduction}

Previous work in this field is insufficient for our needs. We expect signals in the picoamp range on the microsecond timescale, and thus require circuitry able to amplify and measure quickly \cite{mosharok2005aee}. Other work has not addressed timing requirements \cite{zhang2005eam} \cite{steffan2007scp}, assumes slow concentration change times on the order of seconds \cite{murari2005ipn}, or uses oversampling (which is slow) to detect low concentrations \cite{murari2005ipn} \cite{stanacevic2007vpa}.
