\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}

We fabricated a chip with an array of electrochemical sensor cells of varying make. This chip was characterized to find high-performing electrodes which were each characterized by the response to various concentrations of expected chemicals that would be released by living cells. An initial potentiostat design for future use in a chip was presented to handle the low signals expected during analysis with living cells.
