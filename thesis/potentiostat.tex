\chapter{Potentiostat Design}

The chip characterized thus far is an array with 21 sensor sites, each with 4 electrode sets (that is, auxilliary, reference, and working electrodes). The future goal of this work is to have a similar electrode configuration over the entire array, which will be somewhere above 80 electrode sets. This could require a large external probe station on which to make these measurements, with each electrode set having its own expensive potentiostat. This is obviously either prohibitively expensive, logistically impossible, or simply foolish. Instead, the future chip should have individual potentiostats for every electrode set. Since we are attempting to measure signals in the picoamp and microsecond range, these potentiostats must be low noise (on the order of femtoamps) and have bandwidth of at least 1MHz \cite{mosharok2005AEERA}.
