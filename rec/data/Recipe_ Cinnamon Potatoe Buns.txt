DOUGH 1/2 SMALL russet potato, peeled diced 1/2 Cup milk 1/4 Cup margarine, room temperature cut in pieces 1/4 Cup sugar 1 large egg 1 envelope yeast, quick rising
1/4 Cup warm water 4 1/4 Cups flour
FILLING 1/2 Cup sugar 1 Teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 Cup walnuts, chopped
3/4 Cup raisins 1/2 Cup brown sugar, packed 1/2 Cup butter, melted, cooled
DOUGH: Cook potato in small saucepan of boiling water until very tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potato. Transfer to processor and puree until smooth.
Add milk, margarine, sugar and salt to processor and blend well. Mix in egg. Add yeast and warm water and process to blend. Mix in enough flour, 1 cup at a time, to form soft dough. Transfer dought to floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes.
Butter large bowl. Form dough into ball; add to bowl and turn to coat with butter. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, then towel. Let dough rise in warm draft-free area until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.
FILLING: Butter two 13x9x2-inch baking pans. Mix first 2 ingredients in small bowl. Punch down dough. Roll dough out on floured surface to 18x2-inch rectangle. Sprinkle cinnamon mixture over dough, leaving 1-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle nuts, raisins and brown sugar evenly over dough. Drizzle with melted butter. Starting at 1 long side, roll up tightly jelly roll style.
Cut roll crosswise into 18 slices. Arrange 9 dough slices, cut side down, in each prepared pan, spacing evenly. Cover pans with plastic wrap, then kitchen towel. Let buns rise in warm draft-free area until puffed and almost doubled, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake buns uncovered until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Cool on rack 5 minutes before serving. (Can be prepared 2 weeks ahead. Cool cinnamon buns completely. Wrap tightly in foil and reeze. Thaw; rewarm, still wrapped, in 350 degree oven about 10 minutes.)
