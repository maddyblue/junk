Amount Measure Ingredient Preparation -------------- ------------ -------------- ----------------
1 small` apple, green , tart-granny smith 3 Tablespoons flour
1/2 Teaspoon salt 1/4 Teaspoon pepper 1/4 Teaspoon cinnamon 4 chicken breasts, boneless 1 Tablespoon butter 2 Tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil 1 1/4 Cups apple juice
1/2 Cup raisins 2 Tablespoons half-half
Cut the unpeeled apple into small cubes or dice and set aside. In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, salt, pepper and cinnamon. Dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour and reserve any excess dredging mixture.
In a large skillet, melt the butter in the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the chicken and saute until golden all over, about 3 minutes per side. Remove the chicken to a plate.
Add the reserved dredging mixture to the drippings in the skillet and cook it, stirring constantly, until it is a light golden color, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/4 cup of the cider and stir until the sauce is smooth. Stir in another 1/2 cup and check the consistency of the sauce. If youw ould prefer a thinner sauce, add up to 1/2 cup more cider.
Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Return the chicken to the skillet and add the diced apple and the raisins. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and simmer, covered, until the chicken is tender and opaque throughout, about 5 minutes longer. Remove the chicken to a plate.
Stir the cream into the sauce in the pan. To serve, top each chicken breast with some of the sauce, diced apple and raisins.
