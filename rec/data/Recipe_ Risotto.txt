Amount Measure Ingredient Preparation -------------- ------------ -------------- ----------------
6 Cups chicken stock
1/4 Cup olive oil 1/2 Cup onion, chopped 2 Cups Rice, Arborio or Carnaroli 1 Cup white wine, dry 2 Tablespoons butter
salt and pepper
In a sauce pan over medium heat, bring the stock to a gentle simmer and maintain over low heat.
In a large, hevy saucepan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the onion and saute until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and stir until each grain is well coated with oil and translucent with a white dot in the center, about 3 minutes. Add the wine and stir until it is completely absorbed.
Add the simmering stock a ladleful at a time, stirring frequently after each addition. Wait unil the stock is almost completely absorbed, but the rice is never dry on top, before adding the next ladleful. Rexserve 1/4 cup stock to add at the end.
When the rice is almost tender to the bite but slightly firm in the center and looks creamy, after about 20 minutes, remove from the heat and stir in butter to taste and the reserved 1/4 cup stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve at once.
