Amount Measure Ingredient Preparation -------------- ------------ -------------- ----------------
1 1/2 Pounds chicken, boneless, skinless 2 Tablespoons flour
1/2 Teaspoon salt 2 Tablespoons butter 2 Tablespoons olive oil or other vegetable oil 2 Cups green grapes, seedless
1/2 Cup chicken broth 1/2 Cup heavy cream 2 Tablespoons chicken broth 2 Tablespoons parsley
Cut the chicken breasts crosswise into 1/2 inch strips. In a small bowl, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Toss the chicken strips in the seasoned flour to cat lightly. Set the chicken aside. In a large skillet, melt the butter in the oil over medium-high heat until hot but not smoking. Add the chicken pieces and stir-fry until the chicken just begins to brown, 3-4 minutes. Add the grapes, chicken broth, and cream. Let the mixture come to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the grapes are slightly sofetened, 3-4 minutes.
