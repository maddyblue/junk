GUIDELINES FOR CI4 STRUCTURE
---------- --- --- ---------

*	CI4 codebase layout uses an extremely strict file layout map.  Though this
	can make things a bit annoying, it pays off with a much higher degree of 
	organization.

	Please try to follow the existing layout as best as you can: place utility
	classes in "/utility", additional game objects in "/objects", etc.  If you
	need to create a new directory, ask dolmant or I before continuing.

*	When designing pieces of CI4, whenever possible, make pieces of code
	likely to be reused multiple times a class, and be sure to follow
	good class design when doing this.  This, too, improves organization, and
	also makes the CI code easier to follow.
