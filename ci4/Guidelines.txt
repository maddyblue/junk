GUIDELINES FOR CI4 STRUCTURE
---------- --- --- ---------

* CI4 codebase layout uses an extremely strict file layout map.  Though this
  can make things a bit annoying, it pays off with a much higher degree of
  organization.

  Please try to follow the existing layout as best as you can: place utility
  classes in "/utility", additional game objects in "/objects", etc.  If you
  need to create a new directory, ask dolmant or I before continuing.

* When designing pieces of CI4, whenever possible, make pieces of code
  likely to be reused multiple times a class, and be sure to follow
  good class design when doing this.  This, too, improves organization, and
  also makes the CI code easier to follow.

* If you're doing artwork for CI4, please, please try to prefix your art
  with some sort of unique identifier, i.e. your forum username, your initials,
  whatever.  We will copy the images we will be using on the site to a standard
  name (ie: dolmant_ci.gif (for a gif dolmant would make, for example) would
  become ci.gif if we decided to use it on the site.
