Note to CI4 contributors (and regular developers):

To keep some sanity when you view the CI4 code, it's recommended that you set your tab-space value to 2.  (If it's not set at 2 already, why the hell isn't it?  :) )

We like using tabs.  It helps makes code look organizable.  Unfortunately, if your tab space is like something insane like 8, you're not going to have much fun, especially on a normal 80x24 terminal.

Just a note for your comfort.
