  <div class="entry-content"><p>I would like to announce the release of <a href="http://www.goread.io">Go Read</a>. It as a Google Reader clone, and designed to be close to its simplicity and cleanliness. I wanted to build something as close to Google Reader as made sense for one person to build in a few months. Since the announcement, numerous clones have been written, and some existing ones were made known. I tried most of them and disliked them for various reasons. It seemed interesting and fun to make my own that would serve exactly my needs. I hope others find it useful.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.goread.io">Try it out:</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.goread.io/"><img src="/assets/images/goread-all.png"></a></p>

<p>Specifically, I wanted:</p>

<ol>
<li>importing of existing google reader and OPML feeds</li>
<li>a web page with decent mobile support</li>
<li>to not install anything ever</li>
<li>a relatively similar look to Google Reader</li>
<li>the same keyboard shortcut keys</li>
<li>snappy and fast</li>
</ol>


<h2>implementation</h2>

<p>Feed readers are difficult.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with the readers I tried over the last months was scalability. While on the front page of HN, they were slow and unusable. Many then ended up restricting their demo tier to something useless or took so long to import my feeds that I just forgot about them and never went back. I wanted to architect a reader whose scale would be limited only by how much I was willing to pay for servers. Newsblur&#8217;s early tweets suggested that the database was the bottle neck - they could not simply add new machines because it was not designed to use them. I chose the <a href="http://golang.org">go</a> runtime of <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">app engine</a> and attempted to design the data structures in a way that allowed concurrency. Depending on the traffic I get, we will see if I succeeded.</p>

<p>The second big difficulty is the lack of standards compliance. Most feeds are formatted more-or-less correctly, but you must support three formats (RSS, RDF, Atom). The number of date formats we encountered is comical (so much so that I <a href="http://rssdateformats.tumblr.com/">started a blog</a> to document them). At current count, there are <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/goread/blob/0387db10bd9fd9ccd90d557fa30b6e494efa577a/goapp/utils.go#L129">around 60</a> date formats I&#8217;ve seen. There are others that are just not parsable:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.threewordphrase.com/rss.xml">Wed, 18 2012</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.airtightnetworks.com/fileadmin/rss/press_releases.xml">Tue, 3 Febuary 2010 00:00:00 IST</a></li>
<li><a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/news/rss.xml">Tue, 15 May 2012 24:05:00 UTC</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.alta.si/Rss/?id=1">ƒçet, 24 maj 2012 00:00:00</a></li>
</ul>


<p>To make it snappy and fast, <a href="http://angularjs.org/">angularjs</a> is used. A single page is loaded, and all interaction is JSON. Background requests are made to save read stories, save options, fetch the needed story content. This allows us to render changes to the user even if the server takes a bit to process them - we need to wait for returns to change the UI. Angular&#8217;s data binding is just pleasant. It feels fast.</p>

<p>The entire source is <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/goread">on github</a> under the ISC license. Some other readers are open source, but appeared quite difficult to actually install. Using app engine allows go read to be easily run by anyone else by basically changing a single line; instructions are in the repo. A few hundred feeds can be run under the app engine free quota (number of users is basically unimportant to datastore use).</p>

<h2>future</h2>

<p>Current costs are a few dollars a week. If HN ends up liking it, I assume that will multiply. I plan to add non-annoying ads that are removable with a modest fee to support it. If go read can pay for itself, I will be happy.</p>

<p>There are a few features that are not yet implemented and certainly some bugs. Having a full Google Reader API would be beneficial to the existing reader apps. Pubsubhubbub support is missing. I am unlikely to consider major UI changes or great deviations from the standard reader feature set, but good ones could be proposed. I plan on using go read and improving it as I can.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>pdiffs are worth the time</h1>

<p>After hearing about Brett Slatkin&#8217;s discussion of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMnZiTL0tUc">perceptual diffs</a>, I wanted to try it out on <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a>. I wasn&#8217;t convinced it would be worth the time to implement. But then I started keeping a list of the bugs it would have found. These bugs were hard to find and solve because they were so strange. A CSS refactor missed some rare pages. Changing newlines in our files from <code>\r\n</code> to <code>\n</code> broke multiline strings on localized pages (checksum changed, so it couldn&#8217;t find the localized strings). Other obscure things. Each time this happened I thought that pdiff would have found it before we did. Eventually it became clear that it was worth the time investment.</p>

<h1>implementation</h1>

<p>I decided to use the same deployment style as perscribed in the videos: when new code is pushed, UI tests run, and pdiffs run separately but in parallel. This wouldn&#8217;t add any time to our commit-build-test-deploy cycle. And we could see if there were any problems before deploying to production.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pdiff-build.png"></p>

<p>Our pdiff step is implemented as its own nunit test class in its own category (so it can be run separately from our UI tests). We have a list of URLS and run a selenium process to screenshot each of them in all of our supported languages. Some pages need user input, so we support running arbitrary code before screenshotting. Screenshots are saved on a network drive addressed by their URL, some other identifying string, and build number.</p>

<p>The second step performs the actual diffing. A process recurses through the directories and compares any files with identical URLs and identifying strings, sorted by build number. We pdiff the latest two. There is a free implementation of pdiff online, but that requires calling out to an executable. It turns out writing a naive pdiff implementation is about <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/pdiff/blob/a5974e7e175f2ba53987c53b1596cb27fc85e5a6/pdiff.go#L67">10 lines of code</a>, so we just implmented it ourselves. It&#8217;s trivial to read in two images and compare each pixel. To generate the diff image, start with black and write red if the pixels aren&#8217;t the same. Now we have a list of pdiffs. A static html file showing the pdiffed images is generated. If there are differing images, we have a chat bot (named pdiffy) that announces to our developer room for review.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pdiff-chat.png"></p>

<h1>results</h1>

<p>It was just a few days of work to get this all done. The week after it was running, it found an unpleasant and invisible bug. We were releasing a new feature that needed to turn on at a certain date, and we were off-by-one on the year. pdiff caught it before it could go out.</p>

<p>There are problems. First, it generates lots of false positives. This is because some scripts take a few seconds to initialize, so we have to wait a while before taking a screenshot. Sometimes it&#8217;s not enough, so subtle things change. I&#8217;m bumping up the wait times until these stop. Second, since there&#8217;s no real server, just some static html pages, it&#8217;s not super friendly to use. Ideally, a pdiff server would maintain a list of images that needed review instead of just telling us something changed. Then we wouldn&#8217;t duplicate work of reviewing images some one else already has. This requires a full server that knows what&#8217;s going on. Haven&#8217;t had time for this yet. Finally, we are currently only running pdiff on logged-out, static pages. Pages with dynamic content (i.e., showing random jobs) are not being tested since we have to add server support so it always renders with the same content and user state.</p>

<p>For the future, I am planning on making a REST-like pdiff server running on app engine. I have a <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/go-pdiff">project started already</a> that is partially functional. I chose not to use <a href="https://github.com/bslatkin/dpxdt">dpxdt</a> because I like running things on app engine. And now that <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine">GCE</a> is generally available, it&#8217;s possible to use that to take screen shots. And the go-pdiff backend is just an interface, which means it&#8217;s possible to add a redis or sql backend, and make a vagrant config so it&#8217;s easy to spin up your own internal pdiff server if you don&#8217;t want to use the app engine hosted one.</p>

<h1>conclusion</h1>

<p>Perceptual diffs are not that hard to implement. There are not lots of drop in solutions now. But it is so straightforward to implement, and can catch so many hard kinds of bugs that nothing else can, that it is worth the time and effort.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/blog/2013/02/28/careers-localization-part-2-api/">Previously</a> we have discussed our reasoning and API for localization. Here, we would like to continue with the next topic: <strong>text extraction from the source code</strong>. That is, after we have indicated the text we would like translated, how we extract that text out of our codebase for translation. (Note: we used <a href="http://www.acclaro.com/">Acclaro</a> for the actual translation, and have been very happy with them. Recommended.)</p>

<p>The difficulty is to extract all of the strings so that they can be sent to translators. Compounding this difficulty, we also must make sure to send the correct number of <strong>plural forms</strong> to the translators. Look at the example below. <code>__count</code> does not appear in the translated string, only in the values object. This means we must, at extraction time, understand these value objects and be able to reason about them&#8212;we must know their types.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">_s</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;There is a unicorn&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">__count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="p">})</span> <span class="c1">// &quot;There are some unicorns&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are a few bad ways to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>build a parser by hand to deal with this (possible, but fragile, error-prone, and silently oblivious to things it does not support)</li>
<li>search or grep</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/864236">regex</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Our first solution was the hand-built parser. It worked reasonbly well, but there were known, unfixable bugs. We needed a solution that allowed us to have full syntatic and semantic understanding of source code files. Syntax for knowing the tree of the source code: function calls, argument lists, object access. Semantic for seeing into object types and values.</p>

<h2>C# and Razor extraction with Roslyn</h2>

<p>The C# team at Microsoft has been working on a project called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/roslyn.aspx">Roslyn</a>. It is a programmatic way to access the syntax tree and semantic model of C# files. That means that we can hand it a C# file and then search through it looking for certain kinds of things, and act on them. Roslyn comes with a SyntaxWalker class that walks over each node. You can override the one you want. In our case, we want any invocation (function call) named <code>_s</code> or <code>_m</code>:</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re trying to create a new <code>StringInfo</code> (just a container class). We need to examine our <code>node.ArgumentList</code> and see if the first argument is a string. We use C#&#8217;s dynamic feature coupled with various ways to call <code>StringInfo.Create</code> to easily support different types of arguments (noted in comments above the functions):</p>

<p>Ok, now we&#8217;ve got our string. Next we need to figure out if <code>__count</code> is part of the object. We&#8217;ve implemented various ways to determine <code>HasCount()</code>, as referenced above on line 14. Again, C#&#8217;s dynamic proves useful.</p>

<p>The above tries all variants (that were in our code) that might contain <code>__count</code> somehow. The use of dynamic allows us to not care about the kind of expression, which is determined during runtime, and then the appropriate version of <code>HasCount()</code> is called. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://gist.github.com/mjibson/5052106#file-extractor-cs">a gist</a> of it all (it&#8217;s got some other features not listed here).</p>

<p>The above covers our C# controllers. For the Razor views, we cheat a bit. The ASP.NET compiler is invoked which converts the views into C# files, then the same extraction logic is run on those. This is much easier than trying to write a full razor parser.</p>

<h2>JavaScript extraction with UglifyJS</h2>

<p>For JavaScript, we use a similar technique. <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS">UglifyJS</a> is a JavaScript-based JavaScript parser. It also can return a syntax tree, which we can examine for uses of <code>_s</code>, from which we can extract strings and objects. It&#8217;s a pretty hideous function and not worth pasting, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/mjibson/5052106#file-extractor-js">here it is</a>.</p>

<p>Both of these extractors yield JSON, which is processed in node and sent off to our translation service. We also have a dashboard (built with <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>) to view all translations, fix them, and reprocess all the files.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Having two full language parsers allows us to be flexible. Both our C# and JavaScript implementations are equally functional at all levels&#8212;API, extraction, display&#8212;allowing us to have one unified API in our codebase.</p>

<p>Translation and localization are hard. We spent months refactoring and extending our codebase to support it. But now, we can change, add, and translate strings with little effort, because our tools handle all the hard stuff. If you care about having quality translations (supporting dynamic text insertion and pluralization), whichever solution you use (resource files or gettext-style) must be able to fully understand your code so that it can generate high-quality output to send to translators.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/blog/2013/02/27/careers-localization-part-1-why-roll-our-own/">Previously</a> we discussed our design requirements and solution for localization. Here we will continue with a description of the API. This means the way in which we would craft strings to be localized.</p>

<h2>Markup</h2>

<p>We chose to use gettext-style translation strings (i.e., not resource files where strings are identified somehow, instead we just indicate the English string right where it will be shown). We chose a syntax that allows dynamic variable replacement and easy pluralization, and can work similarly in JavaScript and C#. Here&#8217;s what we came up with:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We chose a function named <code>_s</code> that takes a string and an optional values object used for variable replacement. There is a special <code>__count</code> member of the values object which, if it exists, indicates to our translation engine that this is a pluralizeable string. Calls to <code>_s</code> could be in our C# files anywhere in the tree. They could also be in our razor views:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Razor</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally, it also supports existing objects:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>C#</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Markdown</h2>

<p>Requirement 5 from part 1 is to support markdown formatting. The purpose of this requirement was so that we would never send HTML to translators. We do not trust someone else writing our HTML. Thus, we needed support for simplified markdown (only bold, italics, and links). Out of this grew the <code>_m</code> function (m for markdown, in contrast to s for string in <code>_s</code>). This puts certain tweets in perspective.</p>

<blockquote><p>And so begins the drive to redefine &#8220;S&M&#8221; in the company lexicon.</p><footer><strong>@kevinmontrose</strong> <cite><a href='https://twitter.com/kevinmontrose/status/233392144193294336'>twitter.com/kevinmontrose/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>With <code>_m</code>, we can do things like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">_m</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hi, **we hate fun** here at [stack overflow](stackoverflow.com).&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>The above API has some problems, or doesn&#8217;t support the following cases:</p>

<h3>Best-practice DOM handling</h3>

<p>Due to the use of markdown instead of HTML, there are some annoyances about how we must treat DOM elements. Let&#8217;s say that, before translation, we had something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">Hello</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">span</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="n">click</span> <span class="n">here</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">span</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">magic</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;#click&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">click</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cb</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In (incorrect) translated form, we would have this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="err">@</span><span class="n">_s</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello,&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">span</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="err">@</span><span class="n">_s</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;click here&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">span</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="err">@</span><span class="n">_s</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;for magic.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is incorrect because the sentence has now been fragmented into three. Translators will then get these three fragments and must translate each on its own, with no power to reorder them if needed in the target language. But, how can we retain the JavaScript action? The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> in there is not supported since we don&#8217;t allow HTML in translated strings (or, more accurately, we encode all output strings so they are HTML-safe). The solution is to use our markdown formatting and do funky stuff with the DOM. In markdown, we have access to <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, thus:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">div</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="err">@</span><span class="n">_m</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello, **click here** for magic.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="err">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;#click strong&quot;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="n">click</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cb</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">script</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>**click here**</code> will render as <code>&lt;strong&gt;click here&lt;/strong&gt;</code>, which we can use in a selector. You must then also apply CSS to disable the normal bolding. Annoying, but it works.</p>

<h3>Gender variants</h3>

<p>Some languages vary articles by the gender (or pluralization) of its object. This is difficult to do because sometimes we don&#8217;t know the gender, and so it&#8217;s impossible to tell the translation engine which gender to use. Consider:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">_s</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;I&#39;m going to $location$.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Brazil&quot;</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In Portuguese, &#8220;to&#8221; varies based on <code>$location$</code>. We need to know the gender and pluralization of <code>$location$</code> (for example, the United States is masculine plural, and so &#8220;to&#8221; would change to &#8220;aos&#8221;). But we allow any location to be entered, so we would have to have that data for each of our target languages for all (or at least many) possible places. We&#8217;re not sure where to get that data, so we&#8217;re not supporting this yet.</p>

<h3>Multiple pluralized words</h3>

<p>We support exactly one <code>__count</code> instance, which means you can&#8217;t have two pluralized words in a sentence. Let&#8217;s consider the following case, assuming we wish to support any number of pluralizable words:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">_s</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;I have $count1$ rainbows and $count2$ pandas.&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">count1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">count2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">})</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>English, German, French (and many others) have two plural forms (singular and other). This means we would have to generate <code>2 ^ 2 = 4</code> combinations of sentences to be pluralized:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">rainbow</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">panda</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">rainbow</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">N</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">N</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">panda</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">N</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">N</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are languages that have <a href="http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html">up to six</a> plural forms: zero, one, two, few, many, other. So, for the above example string, we would have to generate <code>6 ^ 2 = 36</code> combinations:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='cpp'><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">few</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">many</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">other</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">// Etc., with all combinations:</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">few</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">many</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">rainbows</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">few</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">many</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="n">pandas</span><span class="p">.</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>These must all be generated for translation because it is possible that in the target language, the surrounding words could change. For instance, maybe &#8220;have&#8221; changes based on the object, instead of the subject, as in English. Due to this complication, we capped pluralization at one item per string.</p>

<h3>Other things we don&#8217;t know about</h3>

<p>There are many languages, and we&#8217;re sure some of them have constructs that the above API doesn&#8217;t support at all.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The API allows us to do almost everything we need. The limitations ended up being truly limiting in only a few cases, and those could be worked around be restructuring the sentence. The next problem: how do we actually find the usages of <code>_s</code> and send them off to translators?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Localization is a difficult feature to add to a website. A few months ago, we at <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a> localized into <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/de/">German</a>. This took months of effort from much of the team. I would like to describe our design and implementation over a few blog posts.</p>

<p>This post will discuss our design choices.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Localization consists of</p>

<ol>
<li>indicating text that should be localized</li>
<li>translating it</li>
<li>showing the correct translation to the user</li>
</ol>


<p>There are various existing solutions in most programming languages that can do this. We looked at some, but none were able to meet all of our design and support requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>C#</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Razor views</li>
<li>data attributes for localized error messages on form validation</li>
<li>markdown formatting (so that no HTML is ever sent to translators)</li>
<li>dynamic text replacement</li>
<li>pluralization-aware</li>
<li>gettext-style (English text in a function - no resource files and identifiers)</li>
</ol>


<p>We discussed some of these requirements with others who had previously localized their sites. Some had decided to forfeit features due to difficulty of implementation (pluralization, dynamic text). Supporting each of these requirements is difficult, so we understood the decision to omit them. However, we were not willing to do the same.</p>

<h2>Our Solution</h2>

<p>The other solutions missed some our of requirements, or functioned in a way we didn&#8217;t like. We were, however, heavily influenced by existing work, like that of <a href="https://github.com/danielcrenna/i18n">Daniel Crenna</a>. We have a long history of rolling our own software when the 90% solution isn&#8217;t enough, and that tradition was continued here. We ended up writing the entire implementation from scratch. This includes designing an API, extraction process (to determine what strings the translators should translate), and localization engine to support numbers, dates, and translated strings. This allowed us to have a unified pipeline for text extraction and processing (i.e., the C# and JavaScript implementations could be identical at each step of the process), and give us the power and speed we wanted in the implementation.</p>

<p>As will be described in future posts, our implementation met all of our requirements, but with some limitations. Localization is hard, and doing everything is near impossible. If we wanted something better than the 90% solution, then what we have now is maybe in the 95% range: there are still missing features that we haven&#8217;t figured out yet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I would like to announce the release of appstats for go. Installation instructions are <a href="http://godoc.org/github.com/mjibson/appstats">available on godoc.org</a>. I&#8217;d like to thank Dave Symonds for <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/google-appengine-go/laOsfI1dSGY">his help</a> on this project.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://schalmei-go.appspot.com/">demo site</a> is available.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/appstats-timeline.png"><img src="/assets/images/appstats-timeline.png"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/appstats">Appstats</a> is an incredibly useful library for the python (and java) runtimes. The go runtime has had no similar library, adding to the difficulty of developing significant apps. I&#8217;d like to describe a bit about how appstats is implemented (applies to python, as well) and where I think the go runtime is today.</p>

<h2>implementation</h2>

<p>Appstats for go was implemented by copying the python HTML templates, examining the source, and attempting to make something work in go.</p>

<h3>intercepting the data</h3>

<p>In order for appstats to work pleasantly, it needs to automatically populate data from the HTTP request and intercept all RPC calls to app engine&#8217;s services (datastore, memcache, etc.). This is done by a wrapper that provides an <code>appengine.Context</code> instance to a handler function. Both the <code>http.ResponseWriter</code> and <code>appengine.Context</code> variables are actually appstats structs that forward importart calls and record timings and data. Go routines are fully supported: all of the internals are thread-safe, and appstats waits for all RPC calls to complete before serializing and saving its data.</p>

<h3>persist to memcache</h3>

<p>I had always wondered how python appstats stored its data. It was obviously in memcache, but it was interesting how it was able to so quickly store so many requests and fetch them all. How did that work? The timestamp on a request (well, just <code>time.Now()</code> when appstats starts) is used. The current count of microseconds is the memcache key to a request. If it overwrites another request, that&#8217;s ok. For example, a request that happened at <code>04:10:40.40567</code> gets the key <code>40500</code>. The final two digits are converted to 0 so that we can limit the number of keys to 1000. Then, to fetch them all, appstats generates all 1000 possible keys and requests them from memcache. Only existing keys are returned. Each request stores a partial (for the index dashboard) and full (for the details page) item in memcache, with the type (&#8220;part&#8221; or &#8220;full&#8221;) appended to the key name.</p>

<h3>things it doesn&#8217;t have</h3>

<p>There are a few things that python appstats does that this implementation does not (yet). Some may not be possible ever, and some may require Google to help us out a bit:</p>

<ul>
<li>full RPC cost information (only writes cost, currently; reads and small ops not yet implemented)</li>
<li>stack traces with variables and values at each stack frame</li>
<li>protobuf examination for better details (in the &#8220;Response&#8221; and &#8220;Request&#8221; lines of each RPC call on the details page)</li>
</ul>


<h2>today&#8217;s app engine go runtime</h2>

<p>The two killer features of the python runtime on app engine are NDB and appstats. I have been refusing to make a serious app with the go runtime because of this lack. To address those concerns, I have created <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/goon">goon</a> (an NDB-like library for go) and appstats. With the addition of these two libraries, I believe <strong>the go runtime can now compete with python</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am contacted around once per week by people interested in hiring me. Usually email, sometimes on <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com">Careers</a>, even phone calls. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever responded to these. This is not because I&#8217;m against this kind of recruiting, it&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t been persuaded in the least by these offers. My <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mjibson">careers profile</a> even lists me as &#8220;Passive candidate interested in full-time position.&#8221;. That means I have a job, but if you have a better one, maybe I&#8217;ll take it. No one has even piqued my interest, so far. The job offers here (well, not offers, but I&#8217;m not sure of a better term) tell me all about the company and the job, but nothing about how my life will be better there.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s make one up and look it it:</p>

<h2>Software Developer at Fun Startup!</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re a great funded startup with a small and growing team looking to hire the best. We have fun, work on hard problems, and love exciting technologies. You&#8217;ll own large portions of the code and have the freedom to work how you want.</p>

<h4>Skills</h4>

<p>Experience in MVC-based technologies and databases
&#8230;And many other things</p>

<h4>About Us</h4>

<p>We are fun people and awesome. We offer good salaries and benefits.</p>

<h2>Attraction</h2>

<p>The above is about 90% of all the job offers I see, and I will never respond to them. Nowhere in it do they <strong>entice me to work for them</strong>. So many places already offer the same things: startup, small, growing, fun technologies, good salary. I want to see something better than those. What&#8217;s worse, the only list there is a <strong>list of demands</strong> about what I must have. Where is the list of things you&#8217;ll give me? There&#8217;s multiple descriptions of skills I must have, and none about why I should provide those skills to you. I don&#8217;t like job offers that sound like they&#8217;re scrutinizing me. I want something that dazzles me.</p>

<p>For example, a few months ago I was contacted by a company on Careers. I responded not interested. I received a message back asking why. I said: &#8220;I love my current job. Your message didn&#8217;t convince me that I&#8217;d be happier at your company than I am at mine&#8221;. The response was so interesting: <strong> &#8220;can you truly get the sense of what a company is all about from an e-mail message?&#8221;</strong> Fixing that idea is the purpose of this blog post. Here was my final message:</p>

<hr />

<p>I think that is possible to a large degree. For example, my company is also hiring. <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/28723/web-developer-stack-exchange-stack-exchange">Here&#8217;s</a> our job post.</p>

<p>The benefits list is of such high quality that unless I see such a list on another job post, I&#8217;m not interested. I assume that if they had benefits this good, they would list them, since so few places do. The paragraph before the benefits list discusses the quality of the leadership and that they care deeply about making an awesome place to work. I read those two paragraphs alone and I don&#8217;t care about the rest of the job post, because I get a sense that they&#8217;ll treat me like a king, which they do.</p>

<p>The work descriptions of your message were great. I&#8217;m sure the work would be fun and satisfying, and that I would like working with the team. But without advertising the actual working conditions and how I&#8217;ll be treated beyond salary, it&#8217;s hard to switch.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If companies want to attract the best developers, they must publicly advertise <em>why</em> their job is better. Without that, no amount of &#8220;we&#8217;re awesome&#8221; talk is going to get anywhere.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/mjibson/go-dsp">go-dsp</a> has been around for almost a year now. Recently I have been working on performance improvements. The low-hanging fruit was easy (removing duplicate calculations, smarter array copying, efficient data reordering with bit reversal). The difficult part was getting go routines to work as intended. That is, to have them improve the performance of go-dsp. This turned out to be more difficult than I expected.</p>

<h2>Why the fast Fourier Transform is parallelizable</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DIT-FFT-butterfly.png"><img class="right" src="/assets/images/DIT-FFT-butterfly.png" width="300"></a></p>

<p>The FFT is paralellizable because of how the &#8220;fast&#8221; part is implemented. Given an input of length <code>L</code>, if there exist integers <code>M</code> and <code>N</code> such that <code>L = M * N</code>, then the original problem (one transform of size <code>L</code>) can be restated as <code>M</code> problems of size <code>N</code>. These <code>M</code> problems can be run in parallel. For example, say I have an input of size 8. I can reform this as 2 inputs of size 4. These 2 inputs can be run in parallel.</p>

<h2>Attempts</h2>

<p>Go&#8217;s easy support of go routines was the obvious solution here. I went through <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/go-dsp/tree/mp-test">a few solutions</a> until I found one that was <strong>not</strong> slower. What I discovered was that, although the FFT is highly parallelizable, setting up parallelization can easily take more time than it saves. The actual unit of work that is done is just multiplying two pairs of numbers and saving the result.</p>

<p>My first idea was to use wait groups. This involves a synchronized counter. One go routine is spun up per block (there are <code>M</code> blocks, as described above) and the counter incremented. The go routine decrements the counter when it is done. We wait until the counter is back to zero. Since the number of blocks varies from <code>2</code> to <code>L / 2</code>, this means that for about half of the time, so many go routines are spun up to do a very tiny amount of work that overall runtime increases. Ok, so, only do the wait group solution if it&#8217;ll actually be faster. I ran some tests and found out that (on my machine), if the block size is over 128, it&#8217;s worthwhile to spin up a new go routine. Remember that this solution was always using a single go routine when we were on smaller block sizes, ignoring any potential multicore speedup.</p>

<p>The second idea was to use worker pools. Since the main problem is the creation (not use) of go routines, spin up as many as we will need up front and then send work off to them. From testing I found that putting the number of workers at the value of <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#GOMAXPROCS"><code>GOMAXPROCS</code></a> worked out well. Each worker&#8217;s job is to multiply the number pair described above. So, for each of the <code>n log n</code> iterations, we are sending off <code>L / 2</code> jobs. This ended up performing almost exactly as good as the above solution for larger block sizes, but had the added benefit of working with smaller block sizes, too. I guessed the reason for the lack of more speedup was the communication overhead. The jobs were sent using channels, which aren&#8217;t free.</p>

<p>The final solution addressed that problem by changing the number of jobs from <code>L / 2</code> to the block size (which, as a reminder, goes from <code>2</code> to <code>L / 2</code>). So only during one iteration are we sending the same number of jobs over. Almost always are we sending less. Previously, the jobs were specified by an index. This new solution instead specified a min and max index. The subsequent indicies are calculated in the worker itself. This results in much less channel overhead and distributes some work (index calculation) out to workers.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The original, single-thread solution contains no multicore logic. It benchmarked at around 505ms. The graphs below show performance at <code>GOMAXPROCS = 6</code> and a FFT size of <code>2 ^ 20 = 1048576</code>.</p>

<p>Above are results for the first two attempts. The blue line is the original, single-thread control. The green line shows the very poor performance at small block sizes. The red line shows similar performance as green for large block sizes but that it was able to handle smaller block sizes better (but still not great). Minimum runtime was 1.7x faster (267ms minimum).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/fftmp-2.png"></p>

<p>Here we see the final solution with indexed worker groups. Minimum runtime was 252ms (2.0x speedup). Not the 6x increase I wanted, but it&#8217;s not bad.</p>

<p>The final code (using the indexed worker group solution) is now <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/go-dsp">available</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have compiled some of my <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/128346620/playlist/65QbOiGs3DuWa5I6a9MjXI">favorite piano recordings</a> on spotify. (Sorry rdio folks, I tried to make an equivalent playlist, but rdio doesn&#8217;t have some of the recordings I wanted and I couldn&#8217;t find suitable replacements.) Below are some short program notes.</p>

<h3>Ravel Piano Concerto 2</h3>

<p>One of the best overall. If I had to choose, the second movement is my favorite piano piece. I play it often, when I can. It is soft and meandering. The middle section&#8217;s intensity is a thrilling lift. Goose bumps come regurlarly while listening.</p>

<h3>Stravinsky Three Movements of Petrushka</h3>

<p>Originally a ballet for orchestra, he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trois_mouvements_de_Petrouchka">arranged it for piano</a> by request. I first heard this in 2004 at CSU for the opening of their new music hall. The excellent <a href="http://www.yakovkasman.com/">Yakov Kasman</a> performed and taught a master class. It was the first time I saw someone stand up during a piano solo due to his own intensity and interest in the piece. One of the most exciting and helpful performances I ever saw. I found a copy of the sheet music and was unable to play certain parts. (Being an orchestra original, it is for many instruments. The piano reduction is reduced to sometimes three staves. Having only two hands presents a problem. Somehow Mr. Kasman gets around that limitation.)</p>

<h3>John Adams Phrygian Gates</h3>

<p>A half-hour piece in a minimalist style. It starts simply enough with short phrases repeated many times over. The complexity and beauty increase throughout. Some people do not like minimalism. I feel about it the same as I feel about all music genres: the genre is unimportant, the quality of the sound is what makes it good. Phrygian Gates has many new ideas and sounds, many pleasing. This is why I enjoy it. But for those unfamiliar with minimalism: it has no melody and little harmony. The joy felt here is from understanding what is happening and the genuine feeling of pleasure when hearing something new and original (to me, this is the mark of a great composer).</p>

<h3>Prokofiev Piano Concerti 1, 2, 3</h3>

<p>The Russians are my favorite composers (and often performers; see above). Continuing on my last point about enjoying new sounds, Prokofiev was one of the most inventive composers. Although only a handful of years behind Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev was a century ahead in terms of originality. His concerti are my favorite compositions of his. Unlike Chopin (who was a poor arranger for orchestra, and thus produced piano concerti that are little more than excellent piano over orchestral chord changes), Prokofiev excelled at all voices of the orchestra. His concerti are thus more like duets between piano and orchestra, where each has an important part in the music. I have heard these concerti so many times they no longer sound dissonant. Instead I love hearing the chords because they are so new. My ears don&#8217;t hear things like this. The second concerto, although the least popular of the three, has some of the best rhythms and chords I&#8217;ve heard.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Or: how to win by not studying</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MOSFET_Structure.png"><img class="right" src="/assets/images/mosfet.png" width="300"></a></p>

<p>I once took a junior-level course in college about Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors. As part of the electrical engineering cirriculum, it was an important course. I had no interest whatsoever in the course, and to this day I&#8217;m still not sure what it was about. For example, I once showed up to class (I suspect my attendance was around or below 50%) to turn in a homework assignment and discovered that a midterm was scheduled for that day. I used the homework as the single sheet of notes we were allowed. I similarly neglected many of the courses I took.</p>

<p>I would like to describe here why I did that, my expectations about the future (due to that behavior), and what the future actually brought.</p>

<h2>Succumbing to laziness</h2>

<p>Some facts: In eight years of college, I ended up with two undergraduate degrees (music and computer engineering) and one Master&#8217;s degree (electrical engineering). In the six years of undergrad, I took some 220 credits (averaging 18 per semester). My GPA was around a 3.2 the entire time. During this time, I also wrote a lot of code. I worked on <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/ci">a game</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/iads-pygtk">a startup</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mjibson/slammer">consulted</a>, some <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/ports/print/lilypond/Makefile?rev=1.1;content-type=text%2Fplain">OpenBSD ports</a>.</p>

<p>I found that my grades were not related to the number of credits I was taking. Study time was not the limiting factor, interest was. What I wanted to do was program, and studying was a distraction. <strong>Programming is what I wanted to do, so I did it.</strong> Uninteresting classes just got in the way of writing software. I rarely studied for those classes (I don&#8217;t recall ever once reading any textbook unless it was to solve a specific homework problem), and passed with usually a C. Interesting classes were fun, so I worked on them (the fun kind of work) and generally got As or Bs. This was my standard: <strong>I&#8217;ll only work if I like it.</strong></p>

<h2>Impressions</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Op-amp_symbol.svg"><img class="right" src="/assets/images/opamp.png" width="300"></a></p>

<p>At the time I felt that I was making mistakes and slacking off. I thought: instead of programming I should be studying for those other classes. I felt like I was messing myself up as an engineer since I was completely ignoring half of my major courses. For example, after 6 years of electrical engineering courses, I still didn&#8217;t know what an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier">op-amp</a> was, even though I had studied them in at least 4 courses. I was convinced that I was making bad choices. I was paying to go to school and not study. I was spending my time doing something that I didn&#8217;t plan on pursuing as a career (I wanted to design processors for Intel or AMD, not program full-time).</p>

<p>But even given this internal doubt, I still couldn&#8217;t bring myself to change. I just didn&#8217;t care about some of my courses, and I enjoyed making software so much that I wasn&#8217;t going to stop working on it to study.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>While finishing up my Master&#8217;s thesis, I had a great time writing the software to collect and process my lab data, and was totally bored by the actual thesis. It was sometime around there that I realized: I&#8217;m a software engineer, not an electrical engineer. All of my degrees pointed to EE, but my background, skills, and experience were strongly in the software camp.</p>

<p>Today I have a job at <a href="http://mattjibson.com/blog/2012/04/28/how-i-got-a-job-at-stack-overflow/">Stack Overflow</a>. Working here has been a dream for around 10 years. I consider myself supremely lucky to have met this major, personal goal. Now, I believe that I could not have gotten this job unless I pursued programming skills to the <strong>detriment of college achievement</strong>. If I had spent my time studying and working on those classes that I didn&#8217;t enjoy, I would not have had the time to work on software. I do not think I would have my current job if I had studied more instead of programming. I&#8217;m convinced that I&#8217;m happier and in a better job because of poor college performance than if I had excelled at college. I suspect in that case I would have a less interesting job doing something I&#8217;m less excited about.</p>

<h2>For others</h2>

<p>This is what worked for me. I wrote this blog post not to encourage students to slack off their course work, but to offer a real story. I was disappointed in myself for many years until my current job. I think there are some current students who have a similar outlook on their college career, and I wanted to offer this as a potential future.</p>
