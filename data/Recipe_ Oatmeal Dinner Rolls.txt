2 Cups water 1 Cup oats, quick cooking 3 Tablespoons butter 1 pkg yeast
1/3 Cup water, warm 1/3 Cup brown sugar, packed 1 Tablespoon sugar 1 1/2 Teaspoons salt 5 Cups flour

In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the oat mixture, sugars, salt and 4 cups of flour; beat until smooth. Add enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.

Punch dough down; allow to rest for 10 minutes. Shape into 18 balls. Place in two greased 9-inch round baking pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans to wire racks.
