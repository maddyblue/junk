ORANGE SPICE PUMPKIN BREAD
Recipe By : William Sonoma Serving Size : 10 Preparation Time : 0:00 Categories : Breads
Amount Measure Ingredient Preparation -------------- ------------ -------------- ----------------
1 1/2 Cups flour
1/2 Teaspoon baking powder 3/4 Teaspoon baking soda 1/4 Teaspoon salt 1/2 Teaspoon ginger 1/4 Teaspoon nutmeg 1/4 Teaspoon cinnamon 10 Tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/2 Cup brown sugar 1 Cup sugar 2 Teaspoons orange zest 3 eggs, lightly beaten 1 Cup pumpkin puree
Have all ingredients at room temperature. Position rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 350. Greas and flour a pumpkin loaf pan; tap out excess flour.
To make the bread, over a sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon. Set aside
In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat together the butter, brown sugar, sugar, and orange zest until well blended, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs and pumpkin puree and beat until incorporated, 2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the flour mixture in two additions just until smooth.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until the top springs back when touched and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, make the glaze: In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the water, orange zest and ginger. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 3 minutes. Pour the mixture through a fine sieve set over a glass measuring cup.
Pour 1/2 of the orange-ginger mixture into a clean small saucepan. Whisk in the sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, uncovered, for 2 minutes to thicken slightly.
Tap the loaf pan gently on a work surface to loosen the bread. Set the rack over a sheet of waxed paper, invert the pan onto the rack and lift off the pan. Turn the loaf over and using a pastry brush, brush it with the warm glaze. Let cool completely or serve slightly warm.
