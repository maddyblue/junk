Amount Measure Ingredient Preparation -------------- ------------ -------------- ----------------
1 Teaspoon yeast 1 Teaspoon sugar
1/2 Cup water, warm 4 Cups flour 2 1/2 Teaspoons salt
In a large bowl sprinkle yeast and sugar over warm water and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. With a wooden spoon stir in 2 cups flour until combined. Stir in salt and 2 cups of remaining flour until mixture forms a stiff dough.
On a lightly floured surface knead dough with lightly floured hands 8 minutes, or until smooth and elastic, kneading in enough flour to keep dough from sticking. Transfer dough to a lightly oiled deep bowl, turning to coat with oil, and let rise, bowl covered with plastic wrap, until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Punch down dough and form into a long slender loaf about 21 inches long and 3 inches wide. Put loaf diagonally on a lightly greased large or 17by14 baking sheet and let rise, uncovered, about 30 minutes. Baguette may be made up to this point 4 hours ahead and chilled.
Make 3 or 4 diagonal slashes on laof with a sharp knife and light brush top with cool water. Bake loaf in middle of oven 30 minutes, or until golden, and transfer to a rack to cool.
